## Background
Welcome to the React coding exercise. The displayed product
is only there to show as an example and some of the css has
been defined for you.

## Problem
Using React we would like you to create a simplified version
of a products listing page.

Please aim to spend no more than 2-3 hours and complete as
many of the following features as possible
1. Have all the items in /src/api/mock.js listed in a
   grid 3 products wide and responsive to where it will only be
   one product wide for a typical mobile device
2. Add the ability to Favorite an item.
    - After interacting with the heart the heart should look
      visually diffrent.
    - A count of the number of favorited items should be shown
      in the  header
3. Interacting with the Favorites link should display only
   the products that have been favorited

## Extra Credit
- add unit tests
- add the ability for a user to rate a product (i.e. give it only 1 star)
- use typescript
